# Oliynyk Lab @ CUNY, Hunter College

## Welcome!

We are the Oliynyk Lab, a research group at CUNY, Hunter College, led by [Dr. Anton O. Oliynyk](https://hunter.cuny.edu/people/anton-oliynyk/).

## What We Do

In our lab, we explore the wild world of intermetallics—those intriguing compounds where metals and metalloids team up. Our mission? To discover novel compounds, unravel their crystal structures, and see just how far these materials can go.

## How We Do It

- **High-Temp Synthesis:** We cook up new compounds with methods like sintering, arc-melting, and metal flux growth.
- **Characterization:** We use powder and single crystal diffraction, along with electron microscopy, to reveal the secrets of our creations.
- **Mechanical & Electronic Studies:** We dive into the electronic structure and mechanical properties to understand what makes these materials tick.
- **Machine Learning:** With a special focus on uranium, thorium, and rare-earth intermetallics, we use machine learning to predict crystal structures and physical properties—then validate those predictions in the lab.

## Projects

- **[CIF Bond Analyzer](https://github.com/bobleesj/cif-bond-analyzer):** Computes the minimum atomic bonding distances from sites, generating histograms and pair counts.

- **[Structure Analyzer/Featurizer](https://github.com/bobleesj/structure-analyzer-featurizer):** Generates geometric features of interatomic distances, atomic environment information, and coordination numbers.

- **[Composition Analyzer/Featurizer](https://github.com/bobleesj/composition-analyzer-featurizer):** Generates chemical compositional features and provides tools for filtering, sorting, and merging data.

## Why It Matters

By blending cutting-edge synthesis, characterization, and machine learning, we're pushing the boundaries of materials science, one intermetallic at a time.
